## About
OpenBoxes was initially conceptualized by staff at [Partners In Health](https://www.pih.org/article/need-know-openboxes-and-supply-chain) as a way to digitize the delivery, inventory, and consumption of emergency medical supplies in Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake.

Today, OpenBoxes runs in healthcare facilities all over the world, including in Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Rwanda, Liberia, and the United States, providing staff with the tools they need to ensure that lifesaving medication is always available to patients when they need it.

As a community, OpenBoxes strives for:

üöÄ **Efficiency**: The application should run smoothly, reliably, and affordably in low-resource environments.

‚Ü™Ô∏è **Flexibility**: The application should be adaptable to the everchanging needs of each facility, and flexible enough to apply itself to the unique requirements and structures of vastly different supply chains systems.

ü§ù **Accessibility**: The application should be intuitive to use, simple to get up and running, and affordable to maintain.

üé© **Sophistication**: We don't want the accessibility of our software to come at the expense of quality. We pride ourselves on open-sourcing a world-class suite of feature-rich tools that you'd normally expect to see only in paid, enterprise tier software.

While OpenBoxes has grown into a robust, general-purpose warehouse management system that services supply chains all over the world and across many different industries, our mission remains deeply rooted in our origin story: providing software that everyone can feel empowered by, no matter the scale or context of their operation. 

See [our website](https://openboxes.com/features/) for a list of some of the primary features of the application or check out our [demo site](https://demo.openboxes.com/openboxes/auth/signup) to experiment with the application yourself!
