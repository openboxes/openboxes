> If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we kindly ask that you notify us by sending an email to info@openboxes.com.

## Why have a CoC (Code Of Conduct)? 
Open Source projects thrive in diverse communities. Having voices from a wide range of backgrounds provides an essential breadth of perspectives that improves the quality of the project by ensuring our work is clear, accessible, and comprehensive.

We also understand that it is important to do more than simply welcoming a diverse community. We need to actively foster one by providing a safe, inclusive space for our community members, regardless of their identity and background.

This Code of Conduct is not meant to scare away people from contributing. It is meant as a set of guidelines that we can all follow, together as a team, to ensure that we are being active participants in creating and maintaining a healthy, cooperative community.

## Who does the CoC apply to?
This Code of Conduct applies equally to everyone in the OpenBoxes community, from founders, to contributors, to users. We believe that leaders should lead by example, and so we hold ourselves equally accountable to these guidelines. Nobody should receive special treatment, especially when it is at the expense of others.

## Where does the CoC apply?
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the OpenBoxes project. This includes our Slack, the community forums, GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions, and any other spaces used by the OpenBoxes community for communication about the project.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Violations of this Code of Conduct that occur outside OpenBoxes spaces may still affect a person's ability to participate within them.


# ⭐ Code of Conduct
- **Be welcoming.** Being an open source project inherently makes OpenBoxes a world-wide community. As such, it is our responsibility to provide an environment that supports and encourages people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, social and economic class, educational level, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, family status, religion, and mental and physical ability. Remember that joining a new project can be intimidating. The more we can encourage and support new contributors through empathy and kindness, the more likely they are to stick around.

- **Be patient and understanding.** Not everyone shares your particular background and expertise. Give grace when someone expresses confusion or makes a mistake. Remember that we're a global community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language. Provide additional context when required, or see if you can communicate your message in a different way.

- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others, so remember to take them into account when making decisions. When making decisions, focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

- **Be respectful.** We are a community of professionals, and so should conduct ourselves professionally. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior is never acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using discriminatory terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Every contributor to OpenBoxes brings with them a unique perspective on how to solve the problems that the project faces. As such, disagreements, both social and technical, are an inevitability. The goal is not to avoid having differing views, it is to ensure that when we do, we resolve our disagreements constructively and collaboratively. Remember that:
  - Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
  - Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.
  - Winning an argument is never the goal.
  - The overall health of the community is just as important as the product itself. Sometimes it's best to just let things go.

- **Embrace mistakes.** Everyone, regardless of experience or skill level, makes mistakes. When a mistake happens, instead of resorting to shaming each other, we should strive to use the situation as an opportunity to grow.
  - When someone makes a mistake:
    - Approach the situation with empathy. They're likely already feeling ashamed. They don't need more piled on.
    - Find out where the confusion came from. Often a mistake highlights a gap in documentation, testing or communication that we can work to mend.
    - Help them learn. If they're unclear on why the mistake happened, point them to documentation or examples that will help them understand.
    - Work collaboratively alongside them to fix the mistake. If they have the capacity to fix the problem themselves, allow them to do so, but provide guidance when needed or asked.
  - When you make a mistake:
    - Be kind to yourself. It happens to everyone. If you wouldn't get upset at someone else for making a mistake, don't get upset at yourself.
    - Accept responsibility. The earlier we can identify an issue, the more time we have to resolve it with minimal impact.
    - Work collaboratively with the team to solve any issues that emerge. Ask for help if you need it.
    - Gracefully accept constructive feedback.

# 📒 CoC Enforcement Guidelines
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct is the responsibility of the community leaders and project owners. As such, it is the responsibility of community leaders to actively monitor the public spaces of the OpenBoxes project.

Is up to the discretion of community leaders to determine if an action or behavior has violated the Code of Conduct.

## Reporting a Violation
Community members may report Code of Conduct violations to community leaders. Members map report violations whether they happen in public OpenBoxes spaces or in private spaces, such as DMs or emails.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we kindly ask that you notify us by sending an email to info@openboxes.com.

When a violation has been reported by a community member, community leaders will review the report impartially and take action promptly, ensuring to do so in a way that respects the privacy and security of the reporter. The identity of the reporter should not be revealed unless strictly necessary.

## Enforcement Actions

When a community leader has deemed that a Code of Conduct violation has occurred, they will perform one or more of the following corrective actions:

| Action            | Description Of Action                                                                                                                                      | Common Reasons For Taking Action                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Warning**       | A private, written warning to the offender, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. | The use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome                                                                                                                 |
| **Temporary Ban** | A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or communication with the community, public or private, for a specified period of time.                       | A single, serious violation of community standards or sustained inappropriate behavior despite previous warnings.                                                                                      |
| **Permanent Ban** | A permanent ban from any sort of interaction within the community. Access to the repository and other communication channels will be revoked.              | Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. |

In addition to the above, community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to the Code of Conduct.

For the sake of transparency, any bans or content edits that were performed as a part of enforcing the Code of Conduct should be communicated to the community, unless it is inappropriate or unsafe to do so.

The corrective action(s) to take in response to a violation will depend on the severity of the violation, and whether it is an ongoing occurrence. Ultimately, each case will be evaluated individually, and the resulting action(s) to take are at the discretion of the community leaders.
