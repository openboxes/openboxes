/**
 * Product Classification is a way of categorizing products for the purposes of measuring their impact/importance,
 * which in turn can be used for prioritization/configuration of feature-specific tasks.
 *
 * For example, the stock of fast moving items is more volatile compared to other items. They also often account for
 * a higher percentage of the financial value of the products that are moving through a facility. As such, we may want
 * to view them as more "important", which we designate via a classification ("A" for example). Rules can then be
 * applied to the classification as needed. For instance, we can decide that all "A" products should be be counted at
 * least once a week.
 *
 * It's important to note that the classifications themselves contain no inherent value. It's up to the implementers
 * to decide what a classification really means, which is determined by the feature-specific rules that are configured
 * for each classification.
 *
 * For example, if you're using the ABC Classification rules, the classes "A", "B", "C" are just strings.
 * The meaning comes in when we configure the cycle count feature to require class "A" products to be counted weekly,
 * class "B" products to be counted monthly, and class "C" products to be counted yearly.
