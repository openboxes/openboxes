Sure! Here are the step-by-step installation instructions for OpenBoxes on Windows using Java 8, Tomcat 9, and MySQL 8.

### Step 1: Install Java 8

1. Download Java 8 from the [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html) website.
2. Choose "OpenJDK 8 (LTS)" and the appropriate installer for your system (usually the MSI installer).
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Java 8.

4. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
   - Right-click on `This PC` and select `Properties`.
   - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
   - Click on the `Environment Variables` button.
   - In the `System variables` section, click `New` and enter:
     - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
     - Variable value: `C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.x.x.x-hotspot` (or the path where Java 8 is installed)
   - Add `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the end of the `Path` variable in the `System variables` section.

### Step 2: Install Tomcat 9

1. Download Tomcat 9 from the [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) website.
2. Choose the `32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer` option.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Tomcat 9.
4. During the installation, you can configure Tomcat to run as a service and set the ports if needed (default is 8080).

### Step 3: Install MySQL 8

1. Download MySQL 8 from the [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) website.
2. Choose the `Windows (x86, 64-bit), MySQL Installer MSI`.
3. Run the installer and choose the `Custom` installation.
4. Select `MySQL Server` and other necessary components.
5. Follow the installation steps and configure MySQL:
   - Set the root password.
   - Create a new user for OpenBoxes:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER 'openboxesuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'openboxesuser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

### Step 4: Download and Configure OpenBoxes

1. Download the latest OpenBoxes WAR file from the [OpenBoxes GitHub releases page](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/releases/latest).
2. Move the downloaded `openboxes.war` file to the Tomcat `webapps` directory. By default, this is:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps
   ```

3. Tomcat will automatically deploy the WAR file. You can check the deployment by visiting:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/openboxes
   ```

### Step 5: Configure OpenBoxes

1. Navigate to the OpenBoxes configuration directory:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps\openboxes\WEB-INF\classes
   ```
2. Create a new file named `openboxes-config.groovy` with the following content:

   ```groovy
   dataSource {
       dbCreate = "update" // one of 'create', 'create-drop', 'update'
       url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openboxes?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC"
       username = "openboxesuser"
       password = "yourpassword"
   }
   ```

### Step 6: Start OpenBoxes

Ensure Tomcat is running. Open a browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/openboxes
```
Follow the setup instructions provided by OpenBoxes to complete the installation.

### Step 7: Verify Installation

After the setup, verify that OpenBoxes is properly installed and functioning by logging in with the default credentials provided during the setup process.

### Additional Configuration

You may want to configure Tomcat to start automatically on system boot and set environment variables for Java and MySQL.

1. To set Tomcat to start automatically:
   - Open `Services` (search for `services.msc` in the Start menu).
   - Find `Apache Tomcat 9.0` in the list.
   - Right-click and select `Properties`.
   - Set the `Startup type` to `Automatic`.

2. Add MySQL to your system path:
   - Open `Environment Variables` as described earlier.
   - Add the MySQL bin directory to the `Path` variable:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
     ```

This completes the installation process for OpenBoxes on Windows with Java 8, Tomcat 9, and MySQL 8. If you encounter any issues, refer to the OpenBoxes documentation or community forums for additional support.
