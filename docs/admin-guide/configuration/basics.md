OpenBoxes uses a configuration file `grails-app/conf/application.yml` (formerly, Config.groovy) 
to manage application settings. The `application.yml` file uses a YAML format, which is 
hierarchical and structured by indentation. The configuration properties within this file include 
database connections, server settings, environment-specific configurations, and more.

To review our default configuration file, refer to the [application.yml](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/blob/develop/grails-app/conf/application.yml)
file in our GitHub repository.
