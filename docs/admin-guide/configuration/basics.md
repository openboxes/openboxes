OpenBoxes uses a configuration file `grails-app/conf/application.yml` (formerly, Config.groovy) 
to manage application settings. The `application.yml` file uses a YAML format, which is 
hierarchical and structured by indentation. The configuration properties within this file include 
database connections, server settings, environment-specific configurations, and more.



For more general information about how Grails configuration works, refer to the 
[official Grails documentation](https://grails.github.io/legacy-grails-doc/3.3.16/guide/conf.html).

## Default Configuration File
To review our default configuration file, refer to the snippet below. We will document the
