# Configure HTTPS 

The easiest way to do this is to use Let's Encrypt (Certbot). 
See docs here https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04

## Register your domain name or add an A record for a new 
Instructions are specific to your domain name registrar. The important part is that you need to be 

Let's say you want to use openboxes.example.com. You need to create an A record for this domain so that it 
resolves to your server. It's probably best to have Apache running so you can test that a web page is returned.

### Test with a browser
* Open a web browser
* Enter your domain in the address bar (e.g. openboxes.example.com)
* If you see content like the Apache default page then it's working

### Test with nslookup
If your domain name has been registered properly, execute the following command to make sure there's a valid IP address 
associated with your domain name.
```
$ nslookup openboxes.example.com
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	openboxes.example.com
Address: ###.###.###.###
```

If the domain has not been registered or if the domain name has not been propagated yet, then you'll see a message like this:
```
$ nslookup openboxes.example.com
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

** server can't find openboxes.example.com: NXDOMAIN
```

If you're impatient, you can run the nslookup query against the nameserver where the domain is registered. For example, 
if you've registered with GoDaddy, it would be something like this:
```
$ nslookup openboxes.example.com NS01.DOMAINCONTROL.COM
Server:		NS01.DOMAINCONTROL.COM
Address:	2603:5:2140::1#53

Name:	openboxes.example.com
Address: ###.###.###.###
```



## Install Certbot for Apache 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache
```

## Create new HTTPS certificate
```
sudo certbot --apache -d openboxes.example.com
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/openboxes.example.com/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/openboxes.example.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2019-08-05. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

```

### Test automatic update of certificate
Certbot should have create a cron job to automatically renew the certificate every 90 days. You can test to make sure 
the renewal process works, by running the following command:
```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
