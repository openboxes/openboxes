OpenBoxes supports MySQL 8 as its primary database (we also support MariaDB 10.x). The database 
connection is configured in `application.yml` under the `dataSource` section. The default settings 
should be modified in any production environment to ensure a secure connection. You should follow 
best practices regarding security when configuring your database (i.e. change password, enable SSL, etc).
