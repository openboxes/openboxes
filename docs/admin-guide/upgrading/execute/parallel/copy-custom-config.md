# 2. Copy Custom Configuration

If you've ever made any configuration changes to the application or its dependencies, you'll need to ensure that you
migrate all those changes to the new installation if you want them to take effect there.

If you haven't already done so as a part of the ["plan" phase](../../plan/rollback-strategies/backup-config.md),
take a backup of all of your custom configuration and apply that same configuration to the new installation.
