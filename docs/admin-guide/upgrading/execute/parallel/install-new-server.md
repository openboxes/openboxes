# 1. Install The New Server

Follow the [installation guide](../../../installation/index.md) to install the new version of the application
inside a newly provisioned machine or VM/container.

!!! tip

    The advantage of a parallel upgrade over an in-place one is most reflected in this step. You skip having to
    manage upgrading all of your dependencies and can instead install them from scratch on a clean environment,
    bringing your setup to a more knowable state.
