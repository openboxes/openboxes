When deploying OpenBoxes, you can choose between cloud-based or on-premise hosting. Each option has its own advantages:

- **Cloud Hosting**: Ideal for organizations that require scalability, remote access, and minimal infrastructure management. Cloud providers handle server maintenance, security, and backups, reducing IT overhead.
- **On-Premise Hosting**: Suitable for organizations needing full control over their infrastructure, enhanced security, and compliance with strict data regulations. This option requires in-house IT expertise for maintenance and support.

Consider factors such as cost, scalability, security, and IT capabilities when deciding the best hosting solution for your needs.

## On-Premise
Installing OpenBoxes on-premise requires a bit of work to install the appropriate Ubuntu version on a rack-mounted 
server, desktop, or laptop that you've designated as your server. Our installation docs will not describe how to install 
Ubuntu Desktop or Server, so you'll need to consult Ubuntu docs. Here are a few tutorials that might be helpful.

* [Ubuntu Desktop](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop)
* [Ubuntu Server](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-server)

Once Ubuntu is installed, you can continue to the next step (Installing Ubuntu dependencies).

!!! note
    Contact us if you'd like to discuss what it would take to host OpenBoxes in the cloud and on-premise. This can 
    be useful if Internet and power are unreliable as well as if you have teams distributed across multiple facilities 
    or in multiple countries.
