      # Run all tests against each of the databases defined in the above matrix. We could split the integration
      # tests into a separate job and run the matrix only on that job (because unit tests don't care about the
      # underlying database and so running them against multiple databases is pointless), but matrix jobs are run
      # in parallel, so it wouldn't save us any running time to do that. Plus it would overcomplicate the flow.
      # The jacocoTestReport task dependsOn all tests, and so will run them before generating the report.

      # Additionally, because we're using pull_request instead of pull_request_target (for security purposes) when
      # running tests on PRs (see test-pull-request.yml), forks won't have access to GitHub secrets, so this step will
      # fail if we try to run it. As such, we have to skip publishing Codecov reports when running tests from forks.
