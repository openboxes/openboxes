# Security Policy

This security policy applies to all public repositories under the [OpenBoxes](https://github.com/openboxes) organization on 
GitHub.

## Supported Versions
We provide security updates for the [latest official release](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/releases/latest) of OpenBoxes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in any public project under the [OpenBoxes](https://github.com/openboxes) organization, 
please report it responsibly to [support@openboxes.com](mailto:support@openboxes.com).

## Response SLA
As an open-source project with limited resources, we will do our best to respond to and resolve security issues 
in a timely manner.

We will attempt to acknowledge reports within 5–10 business days and provide a resolution within 90 days, 
depending on the severity and complexity. We will also make every effort to publicly disclose all security 
vulnerabilities as soon as a security update (hotfix) is available.

**Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we’ve had a chance to investigate and provide a fix.**
